# blog-posts

## What is it 
It is a mobile app allowing users to read blog posts. It was built with react native and expo. 

## How it works 
When app is opened, blog posts are displayed in the main screen where users can see different posts as well as information about them such as title, a short summary explaining what it is about, an image and the time it takes to finish reading the whole content. More posts will be loaded when user reaches to the end of the screen as long as there are more posts available. When one of the posts is pressed, user gets navigated into the screen where he/she can read the actual content. Users can also use pull the refresh feature to refresh the page and end up seeing the initial posts only but see more of them when using infinite scroll feature again. 

## How to test 
You can either start a development server and test the app (run commands below) or use the apk file (blog-posts.apk) that is provided. 
- run `npm install` to install dependencies 
- run `npm start` to start a local development server
